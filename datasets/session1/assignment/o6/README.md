Materials and their Mechanical Properties
Mechanical Properties of Design Materials: A Comprehensive Material Dataset

About Dataset
We utilized a dataset of Machine Design materials, which includes information on their mechanical properties. The dataset was obtained from the Autodesk Material Library and comprises 15 columns, also referred to as features/attributes. This dataset is a real-world dataset, and it does not contain any random values. However, due to missing values, we only utilized seven of these columns for our ML model.

To develop a ML model, we employed several Python libraries, including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and graphviz, in addition to other technologies such as Weka, MS Excel, VS Code, Kaggle, Jupyter Notebook, and GitHub. We employed Weka software to swiftly visualize the data and comprehend the relationships between the features, without requiring any programming expertise.

My Problem statement is Material Selection for EV Chassis. So, if you have any specific ideas, be sure to implement them and add the codes on Kaggle.
