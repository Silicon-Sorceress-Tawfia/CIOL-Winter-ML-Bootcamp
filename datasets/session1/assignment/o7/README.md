Overview
This project analyzes fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of various ship types operating in Nigerian waterways. By exploring the fuel efficiency and environmental impact of these vessels, we aim to provide actionable insights for optimizing maritime operations and reducing emissions.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
• Ship Type: Categorizes ships into four main types: Fishing Trawler, Oil Service Boat, Surfer Boat, and Tanker Ship.
• Fuel Consumption (Liters): The total fuel consumed by each ship type during operations.
• CO2 Emission (Kg): The amount of carbon dioxide emitted based on fuel consumption.
• Other Variables: Supporting data used for exploratory analysis.
This dataset was generated to simulate realistic maritime operations in Nigeria, taking into account common ship types, fuel usage patterns, and emissions.

Key Insights:
Fuel Consumption by Ship Type:
o Tanker Ships have the highest average fuel consumption, reflecting their larger size and cargo capacity.
o Surfer Boats consume the least fuel, making them efficient for shorter, high-speed trips.
CO2 Emissions:
o A strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.997) exists between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, confirming that higher fuel usage results in greater emissions.
Statistical Analysis:
o ANOVA tests reveal significant differences in fuel consumption across ship types.
o Tukey HSD analysis pinpoints which ship types differ in fuel consumption and emissions, providing actionable insights.
Future Work
Predictive Analysis
A machine learning model can be explored to predict fuel consumption and CO2 emissions based on ship type and operational factors. This would aid in forecasting and planning for greener maritime logistics.

Visualization
Key visualizations in this project include:
• Bar Charts: Compare average fuel consumption and CO2 emissions across ship types.
• Correlation Matrix: Highlights the strong relationship between fuel and emissions.
• ANOVA Plots: Illustrate statistical differences between groups.
