# Dataset for greenhouse gas modelling in diesel dependent communities transitioning to bioenergy 

The data presented here are from the research article entitled "Greenhouse gas mitigation potential of replacing diesel fuel with wood-based bioenergy in an arctic Indigenous community: A pilot study in Fort McPherson, Canada". Based on a pilot study realized in Northern Canada and life cycle assessment, we provide a set of key parameters and operational data gathered along the biomass supply chain to build a GHG mitigation scenario and compute the quantity and timing of GHG savings in the off-grid community of Fort McPherson, NWT. Given that GHG mitigation scenarios are often assessed against a relative fossil-fuel reference scenario, we are providing two categories of data; 1) data for the reference fossil fuel scenario and; 2) data along the upstream operations of biomass supply chains. Both categories contain data related to the operational processes as well as forest growth or decomposition of unused feedstock. Although the data presented are mostly derived from the boreal forest, they could help guide other communities beyond the boreal to develop a renewable bioenergy system and assess their GHG mitigation options.
