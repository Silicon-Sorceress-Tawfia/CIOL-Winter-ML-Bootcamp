This is a dataset for Bengali sentiment analysis which a merged dataset from the publicly available sentiment dataset. The sources I used to make a merged bangla sentiment dataset are:
1) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cryptexcode/sentnob-sentiment-analysis-in-noisy-bangla-texts
2) https://github.com/atik-05/Bangla_ABSA_Datasets/tree/master
3) https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n53xt69gnf/3
4) https://github.com/shakkhor/Academic-Thesis/blob/master/450/comments.csv
5) https://github.com/mohsinulkabir14/BanglaBook/tree/main/data/csv
After that, i applied some cleaning and preprocessing on this merge dataset.
In the dataset, there are 2 columns. One is "Data" and another is "Label".
There are 3 labels for sentiment labeling.
1) Neutral : 0
2) Positive : 1
3) Negative: 2
