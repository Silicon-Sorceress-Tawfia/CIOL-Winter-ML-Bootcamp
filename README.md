# **CIOL** Presents **Winter ML Bootcamp**

CIOL Winter ML Bootcamp is a basic to advanced technical workshop designed for CIOL members and select external participants. This 1 month long bootcamp aims to build proficiency in machine learning (ML) with a focus on practical applications, assignments, and research-oriented projects. Our goal is to enable participants to gain hands-on experience, contribute to publishable research, and build an impressive GitHub portfolio.
